# Startpage
## Features
 This is a custom Startpage for your Browser. It covers the following features:
 - Display the time instead of the Image for the currently used Search-Engine
 - Use different search-engines
 - Light- and Darkmode
 
## Installation
- Download the repo and unzip it to a folder of your choice
- Set the Startpage of your Browser to the Startpage.html-File (usually there is an Option for that in the Settings of your Browser where you can determine which Page should be loaded when you open the Browser. There you have to enter the Path to the html file. Example: file:///C:/Websites/Startpage.html)
